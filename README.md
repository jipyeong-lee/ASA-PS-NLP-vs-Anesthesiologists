# ASA-PS-NLP-vs-Anesthesiologists
This repository contains the code for an NLP-based ASA-PS classification model, developed to classify the American Society of Anesthesiologistâ€™s Physical Status (ASA-PS) using free-text pre-anesthesia evaluation summaries. The model aims to provide a consistent and objective classification, improving upon the variability seen in human raters.
